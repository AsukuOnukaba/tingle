# CHANGES_REQUEST.md

## Overview
This document lists the key functional and structural changes requested to improve the Tiingle web app. The focus is on enabling proper user interactions, admin workflows, and purchase visibility.

---

## 1. Chat System Implementation
**Goal:**  
Build a real-time chat system where:
- Logged-in users can directly message **creators they have subscribed to**.
- Each creator can have **autogenerated response templates** they can customize (like predefined replies or AI-generated ones).

**Notes / Expected Behavior:**
- Chat should appear in the user dashboard (or a new chat section).
- Each conversation must persist in the database (e.g., Supabase).
- Display timestamps and sender identity (user vs. creator).
- Autogenerated responses can be stored as templates that the creator can select and send.

---

## 2. Creator Application Delivery Issue
**Problem:**  
- When a user submits a creator application, it doesn’t reach the admin login or the admin email.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Submitted creator applications should:
  - Appear under a “Creator Applications” section in the admin dashboard.
  - Trigger an email notification to the admin email address.

---

## 3. Creator Approval System
**Problem:**  
- The admin page currently cannot approve new creator applications.  
- When an application is accepted, the creator does **not** appear in the “Explore” page.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin should be able to:
  - View pending applications.
  - Approve or reject each.
  - Automatically update database status (`isCreator = true` or similar).
- Approved creators should appear dynamically on the Explore page under “Creators.”

---

## 4. Missing Admin Login Page
**Problem:**  
- There is no dedicated admin login or route for admin authentication.

**Expected Behavior:**
- A simple admin login page with:
  - Email + Password fields.
  - Authentication tied to an “admin” flag in the database (or a secure Supabase role).
- After login, redirect to the admin dashboard with restricted access.

---

## 5. Purchases Page Not Updating
**Problem:**  
- Purchases do not show up under “My Purchases” after payment or subscription.

**Expected Behavior:**
- After a successful transaction:
  - Purchase data should be stored in the database (user ID, item ID, timestamp, amount).
  - “My Purchases” page should query and display these entries.
- Ensure the purchase process integrates correctly with Paystack (or current payment gateway).

---

## Additional Notes
- Check all Supabase Edge Functions or serverless functions related to payments, creator applications, and chat for errors.
- Verify proper role-based access (user vs. creator vs. admin).
- Ensure environment variables for Supabase and Paystack are properly configured in `.env`.

---

## Priority Order
1. Chat system creation.
2. Creator application + approval flow.
3. Admin login page.
4. Purchases visibility.

---

## Deliverables
- Functional chat system with persisted messages.
- Working admin dashboard (login, application management, creator approval).
- Explore page dynamically showing approved creators.
- My Purchases page displaying actual purchase data.
